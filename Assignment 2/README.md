  Suggest products tailored to user preferences using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.

- **Seamless Integration**: 
  Integrate both systems into an e-commerce platform to deliver real-time recommendations and size suggestions.

## Features

### Size Suggestion System
- **Data Input**:
  - Customer-provided body measurements (e.g., height, weight, chest size).
  - Historical data such as previous purchases and return feedback.
  - Product-specific size charts.

- **Machine Learning Model**:
  - Leverage regression models or classification algorithms to predict the best size.
  - Continuous learning from new user data to improve predictions.

- **User Interface**:
  - A simple input form for users to provide their measurements.
  - Visual indicators for size recommendations (e.g., fit suggestions: tight, perfect, loose).

### Product Recommendation System
- **Recommendation Types**:
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggest products based on similar user preferences.
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommend products with similar attributes to those previously interacted with by the user.
  - **Hybrid Model**: Combine both methods for improved accuracy.

- **Features**:
  - Personalized product suggestions.
  - "People also bought" and "Recommended for you" sections.
  - Dynamic updates based on user activity.
